Thanks for choosing BukkitUI!
This is the /plugins folder.If this is the first time you've started your server, you might have noticed, that there are to plugins pre-installed.
These plugins, as their filenames imply, are created by BukkitUI, to help monitor your server and perform every day tasks.
-- It gets a bit technical here --
The first plugin, JVMMonitor_BukkitUI.jar monitors the virtual machine your server is running in.
Basically, it tells BukkitUI how much RAM your server is using, and what the recent CPU usage is.
The second plugin, SysIn_BukkitUI.jar allows for BukkitUI to easily send commands to your server. Without this plugin, it is quite difficult to do so.

-- Why is this here? --
I am writing this, to tell you to NOT delete any of these files. Especially NOT at runtime. Deleting these files may cause severe damage to BukkitUI and may
render it useless. Do you want that? I don't think so, so, do your server and BukkitUI a favour and just leave things be :)
